<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
AtliQ Grands, a renowned player in the Indian hospitality industry, is facing a significant downturn in market share and revenue within the luxury/business hotels category.
This decline is attributed to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective decision-making within the management. The need for a revitalization strategy becomes evident as 
the current trajectory threatens the brand's standing in the market.

metrics such as booking patterns, cancellations, occupancy rates, and revenue trends but also goes beyond, offering insights into room categories, property-specific performance, 
and additional factors like peak booking hours and seasonal revenue fluctuations. The implementation of this data-driven approach equips AtliQ Grands with actionable insights, 
paving the way for informed decision-making and a resurgence in market share and revenue. 🚀📊✨
